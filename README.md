## About

ChainTales is a next-generation decentralized blogging platform that combines content freedom with responsible identity. It ensures that only users who have completed KYC verification can publish posts or send cryptocurrency tips, creating a trust-enhanced environment for meaningful, authentic interactions.

Users authenticate via **Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE)**, using their Ethereum wallets instead of traditional usernames and passwords. The identity verification process is handled through a KYC module with context-sensitive privacy controls, allowing users to choose which identity attributes to disclose. Once verified, users can publish blogs, interact with others, and tip creators ‚Äî all within a transparent, blockchain-powered ecosystem.

ChainTales integrates:
- üîê **KYC-Gated Access** ‚Äì Posts and tipping are restricted to verified users only.
- üßæ **Context-Sensitive Privacy** ‚Äì Share only the identity details needed for each interaction.
- üìù **Immutable Blog Posts** ‚Äì Content is stored and tracked through blockchain-backed systems.
- üí∏ **Crypto Tipping** ‚Äì Reward creators with Ethereum-based microtransactions.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Modern Tech Stack** ‚Äì Flask, SQLAlchemy, Web3.py, and Ganache for seamless DApp development.

This project builds on the capabilities of two foundational systems:
- [**BlogChain**](https://github.com/sn1f3rt/BlogChain) ‚Äì A decentralized blogging application with Ethereum login and tipping.
- [**IDenSafe**](https://github.com/sn1f3rt/IDenSafe) ‚Äì A blockchain-based digital identity platform with selective KYC.

ChainTales aims to redefine decentralized content platforms by merging anonymity, accountability, and incentive ‚Äî all while giving users full control over their identity and data.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Python 3.12
- Node.js 18 (& npm)
- MariaDB/MySQL database

## Installation

1. Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

2. Install [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

3. Clone the repository

   ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/sn1f3rt/ChainTales.git
   ```
   
4. Switch to the project directory

   ```shell
    cd ChainTales
   ```
   
5. Create a virtual environment

   ```shell
   make env
   ```
   
6. Activate the virtual environment

   ```shell
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
7. Install Python dependencies

   ```shell
   make install
   ```
   
8. Install [Ganache](https://archive.trufflesuite.com/ganache/) CLI

   ```shell
    npm i
    ```

## Configuration

Create a file named `config.yaml` in the root directory with the following structure:

```yaml
app:
  secret_key: "n_bytes_hex_string"
  testing: true # set to false for production

db:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 3306
  user: "sn1f3rt"
  password: "password"
  name: "chaintales"

web3:
  provider: "http://localhost:7545" # Ganache default

recaptcha:
  site_key: "your_recaptcha_site_key"
  secret_key: "your_recaptcha_secret_key"

```

- update the `SECRET_KEY` variable with a 32-bit hexadecimal string.
- update the `DB_*` variables with your database credentials.
- update the `WEB3_PROVIDER` variable with the URL of your Ethereum node.

## Running

### Development

#### Run Ganache CLI

```shell
npm run ganache-dev
```

#### Run the web app

```shell
make dev
```

The app will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production

#### Run Ganache CLI

```shell
npm run ganache-prod
```

#### Run the web app

```shell
make prod
```

or if you want to enable SSL support

```shell
make prod-ssl cert.pem key.pem
```

The app will be running at `http(s)://<YOUR-SERVER_IP>>:13139`. The certificate and key files are required for SSL support.
